ðŸ“Š AI Financial Market Data Analysis
ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project analyzes financial and stock data of AI-focused companies using Python.
The goal is to understand how R&D spending, revenue growth, and events impact company performance and stock prices.

By working on this, I practiced:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Time-series and event impact analysis

Correlation studies and financial insights visualization

ðŸ”¹ Key Insights Extracted

R&D Spending â†’ How much each company spent on Research & Development.

Revenue Earned â†’ Yearly AI revenue generated by the companies.

Date-wise Stock Impact â†’ Stock performance trends over time.

Event-driven Stock Impact â†’ Specific events that caused maximum stock fluctuations.

AI Revenue Growth â†’ Long-term trend of AI-related revenue expansion.

Correlation Analysis â†’ Relationship between R&D, revenue, and stock performance.

Expenditure vs Revenue (year-by-year) â†’ Efficiency of R&D investment in generating revenue.

Event Impact Analysis â†’ Measuring how major events shaped stock movements.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas â†’ Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn â†’ Visualization

Numpy â†’ Numerical operations

ðŸ”¹ Business Relevance

Helps companies evaluate if R&D investments are paying off.

Provides investors with insights on how events influence stock performance.

Useful for financial planning, trend analysis, and risk management.

Can be applied to real-world financial datasets for strategic decision-making.

ðŸ”¹ Interview Prep Pointers
